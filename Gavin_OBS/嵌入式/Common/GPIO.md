## GPIO PIN and PORTS

GPIO pin stands for the General-purpose input/output pin on MCU. It can be either an input pin or output pin, whose behavior can control at the run time. The use of GPIO is driving LEDs, reading digital signals, issuing interrupts, and many.

GPIO port is a collection of GPIO pins. For STM32F407VGx based microcontrollers have 16 I/O pins for each port. GPIO port of different microcontrollers has a different number of pins.

GPIO port of different microcontrollers has a different number of pins. For example, 8051 based microcontroller supports the port of 8 I/O pins. LPC2148 NXP microcontroller supports the port of 32 I/O pins.
